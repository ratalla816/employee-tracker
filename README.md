  ## Description
  
   **AS the CEO of Atalla Corporation**
   I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
   SO THAT I can organize and plan my business.

   GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
   WHEN I start the application
   THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
   WHEN I choose to view all departments
   THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
   WHEN I choose to view all roles
   THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
   WHEN I choose to view all employees
   THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
   WHEN I choose to add a department
   THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
   WHEN I choose to add a role
   THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
   WHEN I choose to add an employee
   THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager and that employee is added to the database
   WHEN I choose to update an employee role
